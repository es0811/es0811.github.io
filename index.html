              Hi! I am an aspiring Software Developer. I am currently pursuing Masters in CS from Georgia Tech University, US. I also hold a Bachelor's Degree
              in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Goa College of Engineering, India.
              Currently, I am based in Atlanta, Georgia and I am looking for internship/ entry level opportunities as a Software Developer. I am most interested in roles
              which involve coding resourceful software, logical thinking and problem solving.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have more than 5 years of experience working as a Controls Engineer where I was actively involved in software development of PLC and Scada/HMI systems.
                This is where I developed a passion for coding and decided to pursue a profession as a Software Developer.
              </p>

          Chips - in - a - row!
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is a internet-browser friendly game which I developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
          This game was also a milestone in one of my Udemy courses, 'Full Stack Bootcamp- By Jose Portilla'.
          This game is played by two players alternatively. Each player has to drop a chip in a 9x9 matrix.
          The player who drops four consecutive chips wins the game!
